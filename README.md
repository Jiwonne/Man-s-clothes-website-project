# Man's clothes website project

Description |

The website is conceptualized with a magazine.

I built this website with 2 classmates.
We used HTML for a basic structure, CSS for beauty and JavaScript dynamically.

We used PHP to gather products, stored on Database.

It was a great experience that I learnt a collaboration on Group Projects.

I am happy for any feedback :)
